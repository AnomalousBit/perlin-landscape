A study on Perlin-based Landscape Mesh Generation using three.js


After reading about several procedural texture and mesh generation techniques, I was very intrigued
when coming across a specific method named Perlin-noise. Roughly, Perlin noise uses waveforms,
combining several variations on amplitude (persistence) and wavelength in order to create 
random data that strikingly resembles features found in nature.
