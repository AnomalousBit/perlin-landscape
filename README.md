A study on Perlin noise based Landscape Mesh Generation using WebGL and three.js


After reading about several procedural texture and mesh generation techniques, I was very intrigued
when coming across a specific method using Perlin noise. Roughly, Perlin noise uses waveforms,
combining several variations on amplitude (persistence) and wavelength in order to create 
random data that strikingly resembles features found in nature.
